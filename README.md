[rez] package to install [Feh].

Here are some beginners instructions on how to use this repository.

## Installation

1. Install [rez] via `python install.py` method
1. Clone/download this repository
1. Ensure at least the folder printed by
   this command `rez config local_packages_path`
1. Open terminal in (extracted) repository folder,
   run `rez build --install`

Feh should now be installed as a [rez] package named `feh`.

## Usage

To run [Feh]: `rez env feh -- feh`

## Maintenance

Whenever new official release come out, update the `__version__`
in `package.py` then re-run `rez build --install`.

If you decide to make another install, e.g. new `commands()` environment
setup, you can instead just update the `+local.` version number to indicate
new releases/versions of your own. See [PEP 540 local version segments].

Also, you can rename `+local.` to something more relevant to you 
e.g. `+mystudio.` or  `+mygithubname.`
